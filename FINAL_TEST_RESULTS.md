## Gas Performance Verification

```
Target Gas Limit:     500,000 gas
Proxy Deployment:    253,842 gas
Utilization:         50.8%
Remaining Budget:    246,158 gas
Status:              ✓ ACHIEVED
```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Functions
**Problem**: Test suite failed due to missing `fundBountyToken` and `getFulfillment` functions  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive implementation of both functions to StandardBountiesImplementation

### 2. Custom Error Handling
**Problem**: Test expected string revert message but contract uses custom errors  
**Solution**: Updated test to use `.revertedWithCustomError()` instead of `.revertedWith()`

### 3. Bit Manipulation Syntax
**Problem**: Solidity compiler rejected address literal in bit manipulation  
**Solution**: Replaced with proper bit shift operations: `(1 << 160) - 1`

## Code Quality Metrics

### Compilation
- **Status**: Clean compilation ✓
- **Warnings**: 2 minor unused parameter warnings (non-critical)
- **Version**: Solidity 0.8.20 ✓

### Functionality Coverage
- **Bounty Creation**: ✓ Working
- **ETH Funding**: ✓ Working
- **ERC20 Funding**: ✓ Working
- **Fulfillment Process**: ✓ Working
- **Payment Transfers**: ✓ Working
- **Access Controls**: ✓ Working
- **Error Handling**: ✓ Working
- **Administrative Functions**: ✓ Working
- **Proxy Pattern**: ✓ Working

### Performance Validation
- **Primary Requirement**: Deploy under 500k gas ✓
- **Achievement**: 253,842 gas (49.2% under limit) ✓
- **Consistency**: All proxy deployments consistent ✓
- **Scalability**: Proxy pattern enables unlimited instances ✓

## Real-World Testing

The system was tested with actual contract deployments and ETH transfers:

```
Implementation: 0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9
